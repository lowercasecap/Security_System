# Raspberry Pi Security System with Computer Vision

![Raspberry Pi Security System]

## Overview
This project is a DIY security system using a Raspberry Pi equipped with a camera module. It utilizes computer vision principles, OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras for object detection and recognition. The system detects and alerts users about intruders or specific objects within its field of view.

## Features
- Object detection and recognition using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Real-time video streaming and processing with OpenCV.
- Motion detection and tracking.
- Customizable alert system (e.g., email, SMS).
- Integration with smart home devices (optional).

## Hardware Requirements
- Raspberry Pi (Model 3B/3B+/4 recommended)
- Raspberry Pi Camera Module
- MicroSD card
- Power supply
- Case (optional)
- Additional peripherals as needed (e.g., monitor, keyboard, mouse)

## Software Requirements
- Raspbian OS installed on the Raspberry Pi
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Required Python libraries (specified in requirements.txt)
